- Be kind to others
- Use appropriate language
- Respect all races / ethnic origins, religions, disabilities, genders, ages, nationalities, veteran status, or sexual orientations / gender identities

## Engage

We encourage every community members to engage one another in conversations. Ideally those conversations would be about Tierion, but we know sometimes people can get off topic (we get it!). 

Ways to engage:

  - Ask questions
- Engage with us on Twitter
  - Tweet us your thoughts / projects / Tierion use cases!

## Grow

At Tierion, we believe in, and highly value, growth mindsets (aka constant improvement / growth over definitive “success”/”failure”). We want to bring that same spirit to our community, and grow with you. There is so much to learn from each other, and with each other. This is also an opportunity to meet people that share similar interests (crypto! hashing data! blockchain!) and grow your network of colleagues / friends.

## Learn

Our community provides opportunities for members to share knowledge and learn. Please give credit where credit is due. This includes giving a “hat tip” to a mentor or citing sources when giving advice to others. 

Cool things to learn about:

- How to verify a Chainpoint proof without Tierion
- How Tierion, Chainpoint works
- The history of the blockchain
- How to set up, operate a node

# Don’t’s

Doing any of the things on the “Don’t” list will result in your removal from the Tierion Community.

## Spam and scams

Everyone hates spam. Don't create misleading content. It's not okay to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content in our communities. 

## Privacy

If someone has posted your personal information you can request the removal of that content. We will take action accordingly.

## Impersonation

Accounts that are established to impersonate another individual and/or company will be removed.

## Copyright

Tierion community members are expected to and must obey / comply with all copyright laws.

## Distasteful, hateful, violent, graphic, or dangerous content

We do not support content that promotes or condones violence or hate against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of these core characteristics. This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line. 

Do not post anything that encourages others to do things that might cause them to be harmed (hacked, physically injured, etc). 

Do not post obscenities. 

## Harassment and cyberbullying

It is not ok to post abusive content on our communities. If harassment crosses the line into a malicious attack it can be reported and may be removed. In some cases, users may be mildly annoying or petty and should be ignored. 

Sexual harassment will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed, and, if continued, will result in the expulsion of the user from the community.

Doxing and DDOS attacks are considered malicious attacks and will result in immediate expulsion of the user and the offending post(s).

## Threats

Predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invasion of privacy, revealing other people's personal information, and inciting others to commit violent acts are taken very seriously. Anyone caught doing these things will be banned from our communities (in some cases, permanently) and will be reported to law enforcement. 

## Nudity or sexual content

It is not acceptable to post, link to, or discuss nudity or sexual content.
